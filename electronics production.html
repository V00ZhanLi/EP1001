    <h2>Electronics production</h2>
<p>In this part, we will be talking about electronics production, basically, how to create our own PCBs, that sounds fun.</p>
    <h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>
<p>So in this part, you will get to learn about PCBs, using the CNC machine for PCB creation, different types of components and some more stuff that you could be interested in.</p>
    <h3>What is a PCB?</h3>
<p>A PCB, printed circuit board, is a manufactored board that mechanically supports and electrically connects electrical or electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate.</p>
    <h3>Why do we create PCBs?</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to why we create our own PCBs, but mainly the reasons would be:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>customize electronics to meet product requirements.</li>
    <li>customized footprint for product so boards can be smaller.</li>
    <li>greater reliability, with something you created, you would rely on it more.</li>
    <li>able to prototype and perform better.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to create PCBs?</h3>
<p>There are also different types of methods to create PCBs. There are mainly 2 ways. Etching and machining.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>etching is when the creator uses different chemicals and other methods such as lithography or transfers to create the traces of the PCB, this method is generally not used much as the methods are pretty complex and there can also be toxic waste after finishing, these methods could be done in a factory, but in our homes, nah.</li>
        <li>The second method is mahining, machining is when you use tools like a CNC cutter and specific cutting bits to mill and cut out the PCBs, of course this have their own cons too like sometimes the machine is very noisy and since it is milling, there will be dust buildup, but this is a prefered method as it is way simpler to execute and the items can be easily bought, as the items are just the machine, copper boards, and the assorted drill bits, compared to the first method where you have to buy chemicals or specific materials.</li>
    </ol>
