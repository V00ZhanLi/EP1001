    <h2>Quick introduction of myself</h2>
<p>first start by right clicking on to get new component, and make sure it is activated, this will be the first part of the cnc product to sketch.</p>
<p>start sketch and write the lengths wanted, the lengths I wrote were 600x400 mm, this will be plenty big for me to use.</p>
<p>after clicking to confirm the parameters, extrude it to the item that is going to be cut's height.</p>
<p>After doing so, go to change parameters and name the lengths created, this way, it will be easier to know which length is for which part and you can adjust it when needed.</p>
<p>after all this is done, create another new component to start the sketch again, this time, it will be the sides, before sketching, make sure your component is correct by making sure you activated the correct component.</p>
<p>now for the sides, the dimensions will be 600x450, so like just now, start a new sketch, write out the parameters.</p>
<p>make sure to extrude it the same as the base.</p>
