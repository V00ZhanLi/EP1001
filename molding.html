    <h2>Molding and casting</h2>
<p>In this part we will be doing molding and casting.</p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Molding and casting is when one creates a mold and then uses it to cast parts, it could be anything, but generally it is used for harder to manufacture parts.</p>
    
    <p>the different types of molding and casting are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>injection</li>
        <li>vacuum forming</li>
        <li>die casting</li>
    </ul>
<p>The list goes on, but these are the most common types.</p>
<p>For the mold, a variety of materials can be used to form it, such as wood, silicone, rubber, metal, tough rigid foam, it coould even be 3D printed, and as for casting, you can cast almost anything, people have casted foods, epoxy, metals, wax, plastic and so on.</p>
<p>You can cast almost anything you want, it is only limited to materials and your imagination.</p>
<p>During the processing of generating the mold and cast, people also sometimes add some additives into them to improve its toughness, things like fibres and fillers have been used.</p>
<p>Singapore also have vendors that provide materials, they are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Art Friend</li>
        <li>Resin Play</li>
        <li>Tinkle Arts</li>
        <li>Mold Creative</li>
    </ul>
<p>The process of generating is:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First planning out on what item is going to be casted</li>
        <li>Designing the mold for the cast using a software</li>
        <li>create the mold</li>
        <li>Pouring the casting material into the mold</li>
        <li>Finally, demolding</li>
    </ol>
<p>When using liquid materials such as wax or silicone, sometimes air bubbles get trapped inside, this will affect the finished product and will sometimes ruin it completely, so we need to remove it all before using it.</p>
    <p>Usually the methods for removing air bubbles are:
    <br/>Knocking the mold on the table
    <br/>Tapping the sides to let the air bubbles rise to the top
    <br/>vibrating the mold
    <br/>Placing it into a vacuum chamber and using vacuum to release all the airbubbles</p>
<p>All these methods work, it just depends on which one you want to use.</p>
<p>The materials we are going to be using may pose some health hazards, below are some of the safety data sheets for the materials we are using.</p>
