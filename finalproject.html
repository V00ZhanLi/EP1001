    <h2>Final Project Time</h2>
<p>Alright its time for final project again, and this will mean we gotta go make something with what we learnt in this module.</p>
<p>Already from the start I have a project idea, it is going to be the same thing as the previous module, but better, it is going to be a game console again, but now with a different game and it is smaller, so it is a lot more portable.</p>
<p>The game I am going to be making would be space invaders, the reason why I want this game is because space invaders is another fun little game I want to make a game console of, and it is easier to play than tetris.</p>
<p>The game's brains is going to be the Attiny85, it has enough pins for the game, and it is way smaller, in my previous project I used an Arduino nano, which is pretty big and lots of the IO is not used.</p>
<p>The entire thing is going to be in an enclosure that is going to be made by a mold, we are going to use the Stepcraft machine to cut out the mold, then we are going to cast it.</p>
<p>This entire thing fulfills the requirements for the final project marking, where you will need to demonstrate subtractive cutting, and some programming.</p>
<p>The things we need to do are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>design a PCB and mill it.</li>
        <li>propgram the Attiny85 and solder the components onto the board and test it.</li>
        <li>design an enclosure and mill it out.</li>
        <li>cast the enclosure and complete the project.</li>
        <li>give final project a test before submitting.</li>
    </ul>
    
<p>Should be easy enough and able to finish everything on time if we don't slack off :p.</p>
<p>The inspiration of this project came from when I was doing my research during the making of my previous project, where I discovered many different game consoles you can make with Arduino and some components, and in that research, I camed upon the Attiny85, and saw lots of projects you can do with it and the fact that it is essentially, an even smaller Arduino for those projects that don't need the whole board.</p>
<p>Then I came upon this video where they show you how they made a game console with the Attiny.</p>

<p>And that is all about the inspiration, now we can get onto the project.</p>
